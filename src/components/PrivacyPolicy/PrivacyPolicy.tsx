          We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to
          explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
          Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
          Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
          Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like
          ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a
          variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up
          for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like
          emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can
          use many Google services when you're signed out or without creating an
          account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.
          You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome
          Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other
          people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust
          your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data
          and how we use it. To help explain things as clearly as possible,
          we've added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key
          terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you
          can contact us.
